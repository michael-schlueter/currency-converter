# Currency Converter
> This is a small React application which allows the user to calculate currency conversions.



## General Information
- I undertook this project in order to familiarize myself with making API requests inside a React application
- Especially I wanted to gain insight about handling the requested data and how to manipulate in order to render it
- I watched the tutorial before trying it for myself which is why there are only slight differences in code
- The purpose of this project was just to learn new things



## Technologies Used
- React 17.0.2
- [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)



## Features
